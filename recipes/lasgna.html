            Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
            
            In a large pot, mix the pork, beef, onion, and water. Season with salt, pepper, allspice, cloves, cinnamon, and chicken seasoning. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer 30 minutes.
            
            Drain liquid from pot into a bowl. Transfer remaining meat mixture to a separate bowl and chill until ready to use. Place bowl with liquid in the refrigerator and chill 1 hour, or until fat has congealed on the surface.
            
            Scrape and discard fat from the chilled liquid. Spoon the meat mixture into pie crusts. Add 1 tablespoon of reserved liquid to each pie. (This prevents them from becoming to dry.) Place top crust on top of each pie and pinch edges to seal. Cut slits in top crust so steam can escape.
            
            Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 50 minutes. Serve immediately or freeze until ready to use.
            
            To re-heat baked tourtieres
            Place dabs of butter on vent holes in pastry. Cover edges of tourtiere with aluminum foil, and re-heat at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 minutes, or until heated through.
